<h1 align="center">url-shortener</h1>

A url shortener made using javascript backend frameworks and mongodb as the database.

## Requirements
- Nodejs
- npm packages: express, mongoose, ejs, shortid ( or just do npm install )

## How does it work
First we take the url form the user as an input and then convert and then we bind the link into another link with a very short domain name and some random string with it so it gets shorter from the original link
